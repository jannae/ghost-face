# Ghost.

I wanted to play around with the concept of facetracking in the browser, using javascript, and came up with this little experiment. I am using the headtracker.js library to capture the face, then javascript and HTML5 techniques to remove all but the face from the video input, and re-draw it to the screen in a ghostly fashion. It's certainly not perfect, but it's pretty cool.
